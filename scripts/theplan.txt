===== THE PLAN =====

Conductor DONE:
	 - Holds the current timestamp of the song
	 - contains the audio node playing the music
	 - Sends out a signal every frame of the current timestamp
	
NoteManager:
	 - Read in the json (or take in the json data from the parser obj)

NotePool:
	 - Holds references to every note in the runtime env and instantiates new
	nodes when necessary

Note:
	 - timestart
	 - timedeath
	 - Is the code inside each individual note
	 - Receives the conductor's signal and appropriately moves or hides
	 or shows itself based on the current timestamp
	 - Fancy particle FX go here
